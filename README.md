 R code for the empirical application in [Yu and Elwert (2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16591). <br />
  <br />
 Using raw NLSY1979 data, first run "Data_preparation", which cleans the data. <br />
 Then, "Analysis" is used to get the main results, i.e., Figure 1 in the main text, and Tables A2, A3, and A4 in Appendix G. "Missingness" is for Table A1 in Appendix G, and "Analysis_Table A5" is for Table A5 in Appendix G. "Diagnostics" provides Figures A2 and A3, as well as Table A6 in Appendix H. Finally "Sensitivity" generates Figures A4 and A5 in Appendix H.
